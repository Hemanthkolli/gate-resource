# gate-resource

A generic quality-gate resource for Concourse CI

## Development

### Prerequisites

* docker is *required* - version 17.06.x is tested; earlier versions may also
  work.

### Running the tests

The tests have been embedded with the `Dockerfile`; ensuring that the testing
environment is consistent across any `docker` enabled platform. When the docker
image builds, the test are run inside the docker container, on failure they
will stop the build.

Run the tests with the following command:

```sh
docker build -t gate-resource .
```

#### Note about the integration tests

If you want to run the integration tests, a bit more work is required. You will require
an actual git repo to which you can push and pull, configured for SSH access. To do this,
add two files to `integration-tests/ssh` (note that names **are** important):

* `test_key`: This is the private key used to authenticate against your repo.
* `test_repo`: This file contains one line of the form `test_repo_url[#test_branch]`.
  If the branch is not specified, it defaults to `master`. For example,
  `git@github.com:concourse-git-tester/git-resource-integration-tests.git` or
  `git@github.com:concourse-git-tester/git-resource-integration-tests.git#testing`
